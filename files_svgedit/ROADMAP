Planned features for ocsvg (SVG editor for ownCloud) as of 0.2-beta5

beta:
 * more saving options (PDF meta information, ...)
 * multiple PDF pages (e.g. split by layer, render single pages)
 * include images into exported PDF (if possible with jsPDF)
 * printing button (like the files_pdfview app)
 * better integration of svg-edit features (doc properties etc.)

1.0:
 * file picker dialogs for image/svg import and saving
 * l10n (set svg-edit language to the current owncloud language)

Ideas for the future:
 * collaborative editing
 * PDF export of more element types (paths, gradients, arrows etc. if possible)
