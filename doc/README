This simple app adds a handle to the left navigation panel.
That handle allows to slide the navigation panel in and out of view.
This helps to gain valuable space on small displays.
The app is kept extremely simple. No configuration section required, all is
integrated right at your finger tip. Check the CONFIGURATION file.
Just activate and use it.

The strategy implemented in this app is somewhat of an experiment. All my apps
are motivated by my desire to learn new skills in modern web technology.
The basic layout of the ownCloud web UI does not really lend itself easily for
modifications as targeted by this app. Reason is that the core framework and
especially some apps use absolute positioning and width/height settings on
widgets computed on scripting level. Overruling those comutations in an
intelligent, non disruptive way is not that easy when you want to keep things
simple. So a few words on the strategy implemented here. I hope this enables
others to contribute to this experiement, especially to extend it by rules
required by additional apps:
The app is loaded like any other app, however it does not register any settings,
preferences or index page inside the ownCloud framework. Instead some small
scripts are added to each view in the web UI: a small script (fluxx.js)
initializing the features by adding the handle and ding a few simple
preparations for its usage. And two small css style definitions. The first
style file (fluxx.css) styles the handle itself, the second one (dynamic.css)
defines rules required when sliding the navigation area in or out. This second
file is where additional rules required by apps can be added (the app internally
define a 'mode' for each app). During the slide animation a third css style file
is temporarily added (transition.css). It takes care of a smooth transition, but
is used only temporarily so that it does not interfere with any transition rules
defined by the app or the ownCloud core itself.
