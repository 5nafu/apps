Roadmap for ocsvg (SVG editor for ownCloud) as of 0.2-beta2

beta:
 * l10n (set language to the current owncloud language)
 * better usage of jQuery UI and OCdialogs (export options etc.)
 * integration in "New File" drop down in file manager, create new svg file

1.0:
 * file picker dialogs for image/svg import and saving

Ideas for the future:
 * collaborative editing
 * PDF export (possible?)
