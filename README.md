#Owncloud Antivirus App   

files_antivirus is an antivirus app for [Owncloud](https://github.com/owncloud) based on [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net).

v0.1

##Details

The idea is to check for virus at upload-time, notifing the user (on screen and/or email) and
remove the file if it's infected.

##Status

The App is not complete yet...
* It can be configured to work with the excecutable or the daemond (not testet) mode of ClamAV
* When the user uploads a file, it's checked
* If an uploaded file is infected, it's deleted and a notification is shown to the user on screen and an email is sent with details.
* Tested in Linux only

##In progress

* Daemond Mode tests

##ToDo

* Background Job to scan all files
* Test uploading from clients
* Configurations Tune-ups
* Other OS Testing
* Look for ideas :P
